For example, if you are using the <code>tex-chtml.js</code> component, then you can remove the <code>tex-mml-chtml.js</code>, <code>tex-svg.js</code>, <code>tex-mml-svg.js</code>, <code>tex-chtml-full.js</code>, and <code>tex-svg-full.js</code> configurations, which will save considerable space.  Indeed, you should be able to remove everything other than <code>tex-chtml.js</code>, and the <code>input/tex/extensions</code>, <code>output/chtml/fonts/woff-v2</code>, <code>adaptors</code>, <code>a11y</code>, and <code>sre</code> directories.  If you are using the results only on the web, you can remove <code>adaptors</code> as well.</p> <p>If you are not using A11Y support (e.g., speech generation, or semantic enrichment), then you can remove <code>a11y</code> and <code>sre</code> as well (though in this case you may need to disable the assistive tools in the MathJax contextual menu in order to avoid MathJax trying to load them when they aren't there).</p> <p>If you are using SVG rather than CommonHTML output (e.g., <code>tex-svg.js</code> rather than <code>tex-chtml.js</code>), you can remove the <code>output/chtml/fonts/woff-v2</code> directory.  If you are using MathML input rather than TeX (e.g., <code>mml-chtml.js</code> rather than <code>tex-chtml.js</code>), then you can remove <code>input/tex/extensions</code> as well.</p>"},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#the-component-files-and-pull-requests","title":"The Component Files and Pull Requests","text":"<p>The <code>es5</code> directory is generated automatically from the contents of the MathJax source repository.
